Transaction user experiences :)

- Not have the back space button move
	put it at a fixed location
- Make the tabbar name for Transactions stay the same
- Make the map button bigger
- adding transactions are slower with sample data!
- improve scrolling performance with huge dataset
- improve way to input data. 1500 for 15.00
- Crashes when trying to add 10-digit number (if only type in 2's f.ex) (1111111111 works)
- Edit transactions
- Delete transactions
