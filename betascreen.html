		<h1>Beta tester screen</h1>
		
		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>Dear beta tester</p>
		<p>Thank you for taking the time to test my application and to read this page!</p>
		<p>Please understand that this is still work in progress and that you play a crucial part in this last production stage where I need your feedback to find bugs, enhance the user interface and general user experience!</p>
		
		<p>Please be harsh! If there is anything at all that you find less than perfectly intuitive or there is a tiny glitch in the design somewhere that I haven't seen, or there is something you just don't like, please let me know! Now is NOT the time to be nice and polite and tell me everything is great.</p>
		
		<h2>Break my code</h2>
		<p>Please do your best in all ways to test the app in ways I might not have imagined it being used. There more strange ways you can find to break my code, the better! I am happy if you find bugs, that means there are less bugs for the final customers to find!</p>
		
		<p>You can get in touch with me on <a href="mailto:sebastian@kle.io">sebastian@kle.io</a></p>

		<p>Thank you!</p>
